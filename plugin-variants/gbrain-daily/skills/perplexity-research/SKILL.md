description: Brain-augmented web research. Sends brain context about a topic to Perplexity, which searches the web with citations and returns what is NEW vs what the brain already knows. Use for entity enrichment, current-state checks, deal monitoring, and freshness deltas. NOT for simple URL fetches (use web_fetch) or brain-only queries (use gbrain query).

# perplexity-research — Brain-Augmented Web Research

> **Convention:** see [conventions/quality.md](../conventions/quality.md) for
> citation rules; every claim from web research lands with a verifiable
> citation, not a paraphrase.
>
> **Convention:** see [conventions/brain-first.md](../conventions/brain-first.md)

> context as part of the Perplexity prompt — the web search focuses on
> the delta between brain knowledge and current web state.

## What this does

Combines existing brain knowledge with Perplexity's web search. The
agent sends brain context about a topic into a Perplexity query;
Perplexity searches + reads + synthesizes multiple pages with citations,
focused on what's NEW relative to the supplied context.

**The key insight:** Perplexity doesn't just search — it reads and
synthesizes with citations. By sending brain context in the
instructions, it knows what you already know, so it surfaces the delta
instead of repeating settled fact.

## When to use this vs other tools

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Deep research with citations | **This skill** — Perplexity + Opus |
| Quick URL content | `web_fetch` |
| Brain-only lookup | `gbrain query` / `gbrain search` |
| Real-time social monitoring | external X / social-media collectors |
| Structured data lookup against a tracker | `skills/data-research/SKILL.md` |

## Output structure

The research output lands as a brain page under `research/<slug>.md` with
this structure:

```markdown
---
title: "[Topic] — Research [YYYY-MM-DD]"
type: research
date: YYYY-MM-DD
brain_context_slugs: ["pages whose context was sent to Perplexity"]
recency_filter: "[hour|day|week|month|none]"
---

# [Topic] — Research [YYYY-MM-DD]

> Executive summary: 2-3 sentences on the delta between brain knowledge
> and current web state.

## Key New Developments
What's changed since the brain was last updated on this topic.

## Confirming Signals
Web evidence validating existing brain knowledge.

## Contradictions or Updates
Things that conflict with the brain — these need a closer look.

## Recommended Brain Updates
Specific page updates the user might want to make based on this research.
Each item: which page, what to add or change, source URL.

## Citations
- [Source title](URL) — accessed YYYY-MM-DD
- [Source title](URL) — accessed YYYY-MM-DD
- ...
```

## Invocation

The skill is markdown agent instructions; the agent uses Perplexity's
API directly (or a host-provided `perplexity` CLI if installed):

```bash
# 1. Pull brain context
gbrain get <slug>                    # or
gbrain query "<topic keywords>"

# 2. Compose the Perplexity query with brain context inline:
#    """
#    Topic: <topic>
#    Brain context (what we already know): <embedded gbrain content>
#    Find: what's NEW since 2026-MM-DD that the brain doesn't reflect.
#    Cite every claim.
#    """

# 3. Call Perplexity's Agent API (or the host's perplexity binary). The
#    Sonar chat-completions endpoint (/chat/completions with
#    "model": "sonar-pro") is being retired and refuses migrated accounts
#    with 403 agent_api_migration_required; use POST /v1/agent:
#    curl https://api.perplexity.ai/v1/agent \
#      -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
#      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
#      -d '{"preset": "low", "instructions": "Cite every claim.", "input": "..."}'
#    Read the answer from the output item with "type": "message" (SDKs
#    expose it as output_text) and the citations from the search results
#    in the output array; inline [n] markers refer to them.

# 4. Write the structured research page via put_page:
gbrain put research/<slug>      # via the put_page operation

# 5. Cross-link entities mentioned (people, companies) per Iron Law.
```

## Presets

| Agent API preset | Replaces | Use when |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `"preset": "low"` | Sonar Pro | Deep analysis, entity enrichment, deal research (multi-step search) |
| `"preset": "fast"` | Sonar | Quick lookups, bulk monitoring, briefing pipelines |

Default to `low`. Drop to `fast` for bulk / cron contexts where cost
matters more than depth. Perplexity does not publish a fixed per-request
price for presets; check its pricing page before running bulk jobs.

## Integration patterns

### Entity enrichment

Called by `skills/enrich/SKILL.md` when an entity page (person, company)
needs current web context:

```bash
BRAIN=$(gbrain get people/<slug> 2>/dev/null)
# Send <slug>'s page content as brain_context to Perplexity, get current
# news / role / context, then update the brain page with what's new.
```

### Deal / company monitoring (cron)

For each active item under `deals/` or `companies/`:

```bash
# Weekly: pull recent news per company; flag changes for review.
```

### Morning briefing

Replace raw `web_fetch` calls in briefing pipelines with this skill so
the agent doesn't re-narrate already-known facts.

## Recency filter

Pass the recency filter on the web search tool:
`"tools": [{"type": "web_search", "filters": {"search_recency_filter": "week"}}]`
with `hour | day | week | month | year`. Useful for news-cycle topics; omit
for evergreen research. Record the value as `recency_filter` in the page
frontmatter.

## When it fails

Follow the [agent operator protocol](../../docs/protocol/AGENT_OPERATOR_v1.md) for any gbrain error `code`, exit code, `[AGENT]` block or notice block. Specific to this skill:

- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` missing or rejected: tell the user the web arm cannot run; answer from the brain only and say so.
- `rate_limited`: retry after the stated delay; for bulk work drop to the cheaper model rather than looping.
- The brain-context search is empty with a degraded notice: the "what's new vs what the brain knows" diff is unreliable; say the brain side was keyword-only.

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Sending NO brain context. Then it's just a search — use `web_fetch`
  instead.
- ❌ Truncating the brain context. The whole point is "knows what you
  know." Send dense context.
- ❌ Discarding citations. Every claim in the output must have a URL.
- ❌ Skipping the cross-link step when entities are mentioned. Iron Law.

## Environment

- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` set in the agent's environment (or in
  `~/.gbrain/.env`).
- Optional: install Perplexity's official CLI for richer streaming output.

- Conventions referenced (`quality.md`, `brain-first.md`, `_brain-filing-rules.md`) are followed.
- Privacy contract preserved: no real names, no fork-specific filesystem path literals, no upstream-fork references.

The full behavior contract is documented in the body sections above; this section exists for the conformance test.

## Output Format
