# Daily Task Prep

## Contract

This skill guarantees:
- Calendar/meetings for today are loaded with brain context per attendee
- Open threads from yesterday are surfaced
- Active tasks reviewed with priority ordering
- Prep briefing is actionable (not just informational)

## Phases

1. **Load calendar.** Check today's meetings. For each: load attendee brain pages, recent timeline, open threads.
2. **Check yesterday's threads.** When google sources exist, `gbrain waiting --json` is the real data source for open threads and unanswered items — prefer it over prose heuristics (it carries loop rows with counterparty, due date, and evidence; see `skills/google-loops/SKILL.md`). Otherwise, search brain for yesterday's timeline entries. Flag anything unresolved.
3. **Review active tasks.** Load `ops/tasks` from brain. Surface P0 and P1 items.
4. **Compile prep briefing.** Per-meeting context cards + open threads + task priorities.

## Output Format

```
Morning Prep — {date}
======================
Meetings today: {N}

## {Meeting 1 title} at {time}
Attendees: {names with brain context}
Context: {recent interactions, open threads}
Prep: {what to know before this meeting}

## Open Threads
- {thread from yesterday, with context}

## Tasks (P0-P1)
- {task with priority}
```

## When it fails

Follow the [agent operator protocol](../../docs/protocol/AGENT_OPERATOR_v1.md) for any gbrain error `code`, exit code, `[AGENT]` block or notice block. Specific to this skill:

- `gbrain waiting` refuses on stale data: run (or ask the user to run) the sync it names, then retry; do not prep from stale mail.
- Meeting-context searches return nothing with a degraded notice: say the brain is searching keywords only right now, instead of "no prior context".

## Anti-Patterns

- Listing meetings without loading attendee context from brain
- Ignoring yesterday's unresolved threads
- Presenting tasks without priority ordering

## Tools outside your MCP surface

This plugin serves the starter tool surface. When a step above names one of these tools and your tool list
does not have it, call request_tools {"surface":"full"} to add it to this session, or run its gbrain CLI equivalent:

- `get_timeline` → `gbrain timeline`

To widen every new session, set this machine's plugin surface with GBRAIN_SURFACE=full.
